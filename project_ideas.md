  * [Sweet Tempered Assonance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qt-gvv6Uq0)

2. PHP Class to file mapper. Smarter autoload.

  * function autoloader, somehow?
  * Warn about side effects
3. IRC bot

  * karma (user++)
  * imageme (show first image from google images)
  * https versions of http links
  * MORE EXTENSIONS
4. Better PHP ORM
  * Configuraiton like PHP_ActiveRecord
  * Good tools (migrations primarily)
  * Not necessarily ActiveRecord
     * doctrine like entity manager
     * `use ActiveRecordTrait`
